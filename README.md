# DigiKeyboard-project
Made by Kaiden Timm
## What is this?
For this project I made python code for data exfiltration via a python TCP socket to a C2 server.

The DigiSpark is a very cheap alternitive to the USB Rubber Ducky, it essentially tells the conmuter it is plugged into that it is a USB keyboard, however this USB keyboard is programmable and types at extremely fast speeds. 

I thought this was really cool beacause there is no way im spending $80 for a fake USB keyboard with a quirky name, so instead I paid $8 for the DigiSpark. 

## How do you use it?

**Step 1.** Download the DigiCode.ino to your digispark 

**Step 2.** Modify the code for the right server IP as well as anything else you would like to change

**Step 3.** Make sure you have the server code running on a host with the IP address bound correctly in the code

**Step 4.** Wait for the victims initial connection

**Step 5.** Send and recieve as many commands as you want

I commented out the code so that it is easier to read and modify

If you are having issues let me know and I will try to help, I'm not an expert so no guarantees.

Happy Hacking :)
